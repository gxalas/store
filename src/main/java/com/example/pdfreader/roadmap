i will have very few pdfs in the folder
i will add only the documents to the database

- create a table with the errors and add the option to delete them:
    - add more values at the dbError entity
    - select option at the table, get selected items and delete them
- check at the tracing if the document is already imported (at db) or
    is waiting to be imported (at the queue)
- create and test the listeners for adding errors:
    - i should display next to the messages the errors

THINGS TO CHECK:
----------------
- handle invoices view (when a file is saved at duplicated, etc)
- handle the dates
